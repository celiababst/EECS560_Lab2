Welcome to my lab 2!

The purpose of this lab is to implement a hash table with separate chaining using a singly linked list in c++. I inserted the records of student ids along with the student names into a hash table. Using the name as the key, I was required to generate the hash value or the index of the hash table at which the record has to be placed. 

For each record to be inserted properly, they must match the format that's in my data.txt file.

ex:
12345 olivia
16234 sabrina

If they are formatted like:

12345: olivia, 16234: sabrina

My program does not read in values correctly.

Thank you!
